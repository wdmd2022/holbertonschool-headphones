For this assignment, we are asked to implement from scratch, without using any library, a fully functional web page that looks like the designer files provided.

## Some notes about interactions:
- the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
- links hover/active: #FF6565
- button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
- max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page


## On mobile it should look like:
